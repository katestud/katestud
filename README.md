### Hi there. 👋 I'm katestud.

I'm a software engineer, currently attending a programming retreat batch at
[Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). I'm interested in a wide range of
coding projects, with a current renewed interest in hardware.

Professionally, I have worked across the digital advertising, natural language
generation, and developer tooling industries. Most recently, I worked at GitHub
in the Developer Experience organization, focused on processes and applications
to improve developer productivity and happiness for GitHub engineers. During my
time at GitHub, I also contributed to well loved features like Issues, Projects,
and Models. I'm most comfortable with Ruby on Rails, with some Golang development
and React thrown in there for good measure.

Very occasionally, I'll write about what I'm working on or thinking about on
[katestud.dev](https://katestud.dev/).

When I'm not coding 👩‍💻, I enjoy dancing 👯‍♀️, traveling 🛫, learning about the quirks of language 😀, and exploring my neighborhood.
